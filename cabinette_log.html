    <h1>Cabinette — Project Log</h1>
    <p>This page will track the progress of my alternative acomodation siting analysis. I don't have much time to devote to it, unfortunately, but it will have served my purpose if it does any of the following...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>refreshes my memory on SQL, which I haven't touched since early in my Ph.D.</li>
        <li>helps me gain familiarity with framing problems and solutions in a business context.</li>
        <li>shows me exactly where to launch my cabinette empire.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I will be using <span style="display: inline-block; padding: 0.1rem 0.4rem; border-radius: 9px; background: rgba(var(--light), 0.12); font-size: 0.85rem; border: 2px solid rgba(13, 255, 0, 0.25);">DMAIC</span> and <span style="display: inline-block; padding: 0.1rem 0.4rem; border-radius: 9px; background: rgba(var(--light), 0.12); font-size: 0.85rem; border: 2px solid rgba(170, 0, 255, 0.25);">Agile</span> 
  principles to guide my work as indicated by the tags in each entry. I will do my best to wear both user and product owner hats and keep the tool as realistic as possible; obviously, there are very real concerns about feasibility (parcel slope favorability of state laws, wildfire risk, etc.) which extend beyond the scope of this project. They may be considered at a later stage.</p>

      <h3> Determinine the scope of the project based on available data</h3>
        <ul>
      <li>User story: I would like to target my investment in launching a new cabinette lodging enterprise. 
        I want a ranked list of potential sites near U.S. National Parks to prioritize scouting efforts. 
        Some considerations I have are the desirability of proximity to multiple parks and consciousness of how competitive the market is.

  <h3>Spike: gather initial datasets</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Acceptance: <br>
      [x] NPS visitation data <br>
      [&ensp;] park visitor center coordinate data <br>
      [&ensp;] OSM lodging and road data<br>
      [x] land status (public/private) data<br>
      [x] flood zone data<br>
      [x] critical habitat data<br>
      [&ensp;] files documented in DATA_SOURCES.md
    </li>
    <p>Notes: Monthly summaries of NPS visitation data from 2020-2024 were downloaded via the <a href="https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/SSRSReports/National%20Reports/Query%20Builder%20for%20Public%20Use%20Statistics%20(1979%20-%20Last%20Calendar%20Year)">Query Builder for Public Use Statistics</a>(note: COVID Shutdown impact currently ignored for this project). Target columns and their definitions are documented in DATA_SOURCES.md.
    A 2023 map of NPS buildings has been downloaded from <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=54fc5620d3bb4793beeb16e9c62dfdd6#overview">ArcGIS</a>. It should be possible to filter features by building name and average the polygons to a point.
    Land status data has been downloaded from <a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/6759abcfd34edfeb8710a004">ScienceBase</a> for states within the project scope.
  FEMA's <a href="https://www.fema.gov/flood-maps/national-flood-hazard-layer">National Flood Hazard Layer</a> will be used to assess flood risk. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/report/table/critical-habitat.html">information</a> on critical habitats will be used to avoid protected areas.
