        <h2>About Me (Professionally)</h2>
        <p>
            My background in Biological and Agricultural Engineering 
            has supported me through, what I would term, my less obvious path 
            towards computational data science. 
            I frequently find myself relying on practical intuition gained 
            from basic engineering training and regularly apply the scientific 
            method professionally and in everyday life.
            Using this foundation, I have built and contributed to research 
            projects that use available data as a basis for decisions, driving 
            actions for the future with lessons from the past. An important 
            focus for me is ensuring that my understanding of the issue is solid.
            I find that, when possible, involving stakeholders early on in the 
            process helps tremendously and can also provide a great starting 
            point for how to frame the findings in a way that highlights their 
            relevance to the decision maker.

            <h3>DGL-PTM</h3>
            <p>The Deep Graph Library Poverty Trap Model (DGL-PTM)is part of an 
                ongoing effort in collaboration with the Netherlands eScience Center 
                to create an Agent Based Model (ABM) framework that supports 
                communication between agents in a network with a population on 
                the scale of millions. Supporting elements from the Deep Graph 
                Library, particularly message-passing, enabled us to leverage 
                matrix operations on GPUs to achieve the necessary capacity. 
                Role: keeping the project on track towards research goals, balancing the 
                ideas of the PI and the eScience team to keep things progressing, and 
                eventually taking a greater role as a developer when administrative 
                upheaval impeded the team's ability to continue.
                Experience gained with: PyTorch, DGL, GitHub collaboration (big one!), 
                software verification (static analysis, model checking, unit testing),
                HPC job scheduling, API documentation, socioeconomic ABMs
                Existing skills exercised: experimental design, technical writing, 
                Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn

            <h3>MLP Bellman Equation Replacement</h3>
            <p>This project was inspired by a need established when scaling up DGL-PTM. 
                the function modeling agent decisions became a tremendous bottleneck. As 
                a replacement, I developed a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that predicts 
                the outputs of the original Bellman equation approximation with an 
                efficacy that made it a viable replacement.
                Role: picking a direction for the replacement function, developing a 
                methodology for selecting a model, conducting the training and testing
                Experience gained with: Machine Learning, algoritmic documentation
                Existing skills exercised: PyTorch,experimental design, technical writing, 
                Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, HPC job scheduling, LaTeX

            <h3>Climate Dashboard</h3>
            <p>This project from my Ph.D.was one of my first experiments in dashboard 
                development and was extra gratifying as it was made available to a broader 
                audience. It was a simple tool to geographically organize data available to 
                the project which spanned across three countries in East Africa. The dashboard 
                also included aggregated summaries of the data, which were designed as 
                communication tools for the project team and stakeholders. While the dashboard 
                itself is no longer available and is, as a 2021 project, outdated, 
                it was a great learning experience which allowed me to explore what I now 
                acknowledge as a small subset of the possibilities of interactive visualizations.
                Role: picking a platform for the dashboard, determining its scope given the 
                available resources, testing the dashboard with stakeholder feedback, arranging 
                for the app deployment with the help of the Purdue Research Computing team
                Experience gained with: dashboard development, flexdashboard, Shiny, dygraphs, leaflet
                Existing skills exercised: data structuring, database querying, data cleaning, 
                merging data sources, bias correction, R, Plotly, GIS, dplyr, stakeholder communication
